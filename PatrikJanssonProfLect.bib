  abstract =      {Earlier studies have introduced a list of high-level
                   evaluation criteria to assess how well a language
                   supports generic programming. Languages that meet all
                   criteria include Haskell because of its type classes
                   and C++ with the concept feature. We refine these
                   criteria into a taxonomy that captures commonalities
                   and differences between type classes in Haskell and
                   concepts in C++ and discuss which differences are
                   incidental and which ones are due to other language
                   features. The taxonomy allows for an improved
                   understanding of language support for generic
                   programming, and the comparison is useful for the
                   ongoing discussions among language designers and
                   users of both languages.},

  abstract =      {This paper is concerned with testing properties of
                   polymorphic functions. The problem is that testing
                   can only be performed on specific monomorphic
                   instances, whereas parametrically polymorphic
                   functions are expected to work for any type. We
                   present a schema for constructing a monomorphic
                   instance for a polymorphic property, such that
                   correctness of that single instance implies
                   correctness for all other instances. We also give a
                   formal definition of the class of polymorphic
                   properties the schema can be used for. Compared to
                   the standard method of testing such properties, our
                   schema leads to a significant reduction of necessary
                   test cases.},
