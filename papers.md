2017-08-29: An overview of those of my papers most closely related to
**dependent types**.

I have been fascinated by dependent types all the time since my first
exposure to the topic in Bengt Nordstr√∂m's doctoral course on
constructive logic (using Alfa) in the late 1990:s.

I have published on the topic since 2003, starting with

* "[Universes for generic programs and proofs in dependent type theory](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC)" (Benke, Dybjer, Jansson).

During a few years I worked with Mu and Ko on redoing parts of the
"Algebra of Programming" book using Agda:

* first paper, in MPC: [Algebra of programming using dependent types](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC)
* extended version in JFP: [Algebra of programming in Agda: Dependent types for relational program derivation](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC)

Perhaps the most important research results I've been involved in are
those related to parametricity theory and dependent types:

* First published at ICFP in 2010: [Parametricity and dependent types](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC)
* hen an extended version in JFP 2012: [Proofs for free - Parametricity for dependent types](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC)

By now I had also started a long-term collaboration with the Postdam
Institute for Climate Impact Research, initiated from our work on AoP
in Agda. This resulted in a number of interesting papers:

* TYPES'2011: [Testing versus proving in climate impact research](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC)
* IFL'2012: [Dependently-typed programming in scientific computing](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC)
* TFPIE'2015: [Domain-Specific Languages of Mathematics: Presenting Mathematical Analysis Using Functional Programming](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:iyewoVqAXLQC)
* LMCS'2017: [Sequential decision problems, dependent types and generic solutions](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:rCNdntzdTkkC)
* (In submission): [Contributions to a computational theory of policy advice and avoidability](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:lg2tdxc6qMwC)

I have also made a few formalisations of useful algorithms on the border between matrix algebra and dependently typed functional programming:

* LMCS'2016: [Certified Context-Free Parsing: A formalisation of Valiant's Algorithm in Agda](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:QsKbpXNoaWkC)
* TyDe'2016: [An Agda formalisation of the transitive closure of block matrices (Extended Abstract)](https://scholar.google.se/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=eIO4EBAAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=eIO4EBAAAAAJ:orDZ08hpP44C)
