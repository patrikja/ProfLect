\section{PhD studies}
I started my research career as a MSc thesis student in the fall of
1994 with Johan Jeuring as my supervisor.
%
He had coined the term ``Polytypic programming'' for what I would
nowadays call datatype generic programming and as I became a PhD
student we set out to chart the territory where category theory and
initial algebras meet programming.
%
I immediately joined in writing the lecture notes for the summer
school on Advanced Functional Programming \citep{jeuringjansson-afp}
and I developed an implementation of these ideas as a language
extension for the functional programming language Haskell~\citep{janssonjeuring1997a}.
%
When I defended my licentiate thesis \citep{jansson97a} in 1997 my supervisor
left Sweden---first for the software company Baan Inc.\ and later for a
permanent position at Utrecht Univ.
%
I still had some supervision until my PhD, but it was at a distance.
%
This meant that already from the third year of my PhD position I had
to lead my own research projects.
%
(I have continued to collaborate with Jeuring now and then.)


With the base theory and the implementation in place I set out to
implement a library of polytypic functions
\citep{janssonjeuring-polylib} and I returned to and further developed
my MSc thesis topic into a journal publication
\citep{janssonjeuring-polyunify}.
%
I made a few longer research visits: to Yale Univ.\ and to Univ.\ of Oxford
 where I worked on lecture notes on Generic Programming
\citep{backhouseetal98}, the underlying theory and implementation
\citep{jansson:PolyP2compiler} and applications to data conversion
\citep{janssonjeuringdc} and rewriting
\citep{janssonjeuringWGP00:rewriting}.
%
In 1999--2000 I was part time on parental leave and part time
finishing my PhD thesis as a monograph \citep{jansson-phdthesis}, combining
and unifying the earlier results.

\section{Assistant Professor}
After my PhD I broadened my competence by teaching new courses and I
took a leading role in the department administration (Director of
Studies, member of the steering group, later Vice Head of Department).
%
I also developed the results on Arrows and Data Conversion into a
journal paper \citep{janssonjeuring-dataconv} and I applied for, and
was granted, a VR project to work on \emph{Generic Functional Programs
  and Proofs} (1.8M SEK, 2003--2005).
%
In this project I worked with a PostDoc (Marcin Benke) with whom I
wrote \citep{benkedybjerjansson2003:gendepty} but I also worked with my
first PhD student Ulf Norell (PhD 2007).
%
We continued development of PolyP (from my PhD thesis) resulting in a
Haskell library version \citep{jansson:PolyP2compiler} and two more
papers \citep{norelljansson2003:PolyHaskell, norelljansson04:ProtoGen}.
%
I identified Dependent Types as a natural setting for generic
programming, and Norell moved on to work on developing the dependently
typed language Agda together with my second PhD student Danielsson
(also PhD 2007).
%
With Danielsson I worked on program correctness through types
resulting in two co-authored papers
\citep{danielssonjansson04:chasingbottoms,
  danielssonetal06:fastandloose} and a few more with only him as
author.
%
I am proud to say that all my graduated PhD students (Norell,
Danielsson and later Bernardy) are still successful in academia, now
themselves at the assistant professor level.

\subsection{Cover project}
In 2003 I was also co-applicant on a project called \emph{Cover ---
  Combining Verification Methods in Software Development} which was
funded with 8M SEK by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.
%
Within this project I worked hard to integrate applications, software
libraries, and theories from the Programming Logic group (mainly Agda
and its standard library) and the Multi group (mainly QuickCheck and
automatic first order theorem provers).
%
I was active in writing the grant application and I also took an
active part in organisation.

\section{Associate Professor}
After the Cover project was finished, I returned to and broadened my
work on generic programming into three tracks (Haskell, \Cpp, Agda):
%
\paragraph{Haskell} I wrote two papers with the generic programming
group in Utrecht: one on testing \citep{janssonjeuring2007:Testing} and
one review paper comparing many generic programming libraries in Haskell:
\citep{Rodriguezetal2008:CompGenLib}.
%
I also started working with J-P. Bernardy as my third PhD student.


\paragraph{\Cpp} I joined the Software Methodologies and Systems (SMS)
group at Chalmers and led a project to understand Generic Programming
(in the \Cpp{} sense) in depth by working out and carefully exploring the
correspondence between Haskell type classes and \Cpp{} Concepts.
%
This resulted in new results, two papers \citep{SMS-Bernardy:2008:CCC,
  bernardy_generic_2010}, a joint workshop \citep{wgp09proceedings} and
new collaborations but the local SMS group dissolved when Prof. Schupp got a
professors' chair in Germany.

\paragraph{Agda} I initiated work on the Algebra of Programming in
Agda (AoPA) and wrote two papers together with Mu and Ko
\citep{mukojansson08:mpc:dcc, MuKoJansson2009AoPA}.
%
I also developed and taught a PhD level course on Algebra of
Programming twice.
%
AoPA is using and building further on results by me, Norell and
Danielsson.
%

\subsection{Climate Impact Research}
A new interesting development started in 2007 when I got involved with
the ``Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)''.
%
They want to develop correct software implementing models in use for
simulating global systems (both for economy and climate) and they
searched for a partner knowing the Algebra of Programming.
%
We have established a collaboration over the years (leading to
publications, EU grants and even an EU call) which I will get back to
later in Section \ref{sec:GSS}.


\section{Professor}

In 2011 I was promoted to Professor in Computer Science at Chalmers
and from 2011--2013 I was Head of the 5-year programme in Computer
Science and Engineering (CSE).
%
In 2013 I was appointed Head of the Division of Software Technology
where I lead around 50 employees.

\subsection{Programs and Proofs}

I was main applicant and project leader for \emph{Strongly Typed
  Libraries for Programs and Proofs} funded with \textbf{2.4M SEK} by
VR (2011--2015).
%
I worked with J-P. Bernardy (AssProf) and C. Ionescu (PostDoc) on
correctness of reusable software components.
%
This project is at the core of my research work and my activities in the
other parallel projects are all somewhat overlapping (I make sure to
formulate workpackages and subprojects to fit with my core interests).

\subsection{Parametricity}
With Bernardy I have been exploring parametricity theory and we have
published one paper on polymorphic testing
\citep{bernardy_testing_2010} and some very interesting results on
Parametricity for Dependent Types \citep{bernardy_parametricity_2010,
  bernardy_proofs_2012}.
%
My feeling is that the results of this project are among the best I
have ever been involved in.

\subsection{Domain Specific Languages}

I was co-applicant on ``\emph{Software Design and Verification using
  Domain Specific Languages}'' funded with \textbf{11M SEK} by the
Swedish Science Council (VR, multi-project grant in strategic
Information and Communication Technology).
%
I was active in the steering group, recruiting PhD students, PostDocs
and an Assistant Professor.
%
Research-wise I worked with my most recent PhD student (Jonas
Dureg√•rd) on theory and applications of Domain Specific Languages
leading to publications on Embedded Parser Generators
\citep{BNFC-meta-Haskell2011} and Functional Enumeration
\citep{duregardHaskell12Feat}.

I am also co-applicant for ``RAW FP: Productivity and Performance
through Resource Aware Functional Programming'' granted with \textbf{25M SEK}
by SSF (2011--2016).
%
I have been active in recruitment, organisation and research (mainly
the work package ``DSL framework'').
%
In addition to the publications mentioned above we also published a
paper on Class Laws in Haskell \citep{jeuringHaskell12ClassLaws}.

My most recent project on DSLs is
``\href{http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/FP/DSLsofMath}{Domain-Specific
  Languages of Mathematics}'', supported by Chalmers Education Quality
Funding (2014--2016).
%
This project will lead to a new BSc level course, but ``... ideally,
the course would improve the mathematical education of computer
scientists and the computer science education of mathematicians.''

\subsection{Global Systems Science}\label{sec:GSS}

In collaboration with PIK I have written three papers, each by
combining knowledge from two fields: one combining \Cpp{} and Haskell
\citep{LinckeJanssonetalDSLWC2009}, one combining testing and proving
\citep{ionescujansson:LIPIcs:2013:3899} and one using dependent types
for scientific computing~\citep{ionescujansson2013DTPinSciComp}.
%
I'm very grateful to C. Ionescu who has been my main contact trough
all these years.

We also managed to secure European funding from the the FP7 FET-Open
scheme to develop a research programme for ``Global Systems Dynamics
and Policy'' (1.3M EUR, 2010--2013).
%
As work package leader and site leader I organised several workshops,
wrote deliverables and participated in meetings with researchers and
practitioners from other fields.

The explicit aim of this work was to establish ``Global Systems
Science (GSS)'' as a multi-disciplinary research area and to secure further
funding from the EU commission.
%
The call
\textbf{\href{http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2074-fetproact-1-2014.html}{FETPROACT1}}
(Future and Emerging Technology, Proactive support for GSS) in Horizon
2020 is concrete evidence on the success of this line of work.
%
I am now site- and workpackage leader in the project GRACeFUL:
``Global systems Rapid Assessment tools through Constraint FUnctional
Languages'' granted (with \textbf{2.4M EUR}, 2015--2018) by the
FETPROACT1 call.
%
In the GRACeFUL project I will work with my new PhD student (I. Lobo
Valbuena) who just started (2015-08-01).

I'm also site-leader for Chalmers in a Center of Excellence for Global
Systems Science (CoEGSS) which will start 2015-10-01 with an initial
3-year funding period.
